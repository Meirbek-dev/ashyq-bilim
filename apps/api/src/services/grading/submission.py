"""
Submission state-machine service.

Owns the explicit student-facing state transitions:

  NOT_STARTED   → DRAFT    (start_submission_v2 — server-stamps started_at)
  DRAFT         → PENDING  (submit, via submit.py)
  DRAFT         → GRADED   (auto-graded quiz/exam, via submit.py)
  RETURNED      → DRAFT    (create_resubmission_draft — new attempt row)

max_attempts is read from AssessmentPolicy (the canonical DB source), NOT from
block content (AssessmentSettings).  This prevents students from bypassing the
limit by submitting through endpoints that only check block-level settings.
