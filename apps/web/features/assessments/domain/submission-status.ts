/**
 * Canonical submission-status for the unified grading workflow.
 *
 * Five states shared by ALL assessment types:
 *   DRAFT      — student is working, not yet submitted
 *   PENDING    — submitted, awaiting teacher or auto-grading
 *   GRADED     — score set, not yet visible to student
 *   PUBLISHED  — score visible to student
 *   RETURNED   — sent back for revision
 *
 * Supersedes:
 *   - SubmissionStatus in features/grading/domain (identical — this is the source)
 *   - ExamAttempt.status IN_PROGRESS/SUBMITTED/AUTO_SUBMITTED
 *       → IN_PROGRESS maps to DRAFT; SUBMITTED/AUTO_SUBMITTED map to PENDING
 *   - CodeSubmission.status PENDING/PROCESSING/COMPLETED/FAILED
 *       → these become internal Judge0 detail; outer Submission stays at PENDING/GRADED
